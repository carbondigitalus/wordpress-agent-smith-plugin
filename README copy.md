# Zynith SEO Plugin

<div align="center">
  <p align="center">
   The **Agent Smith Plugin** ensures uninterrupted WordPress core, plugin, and theme updates by providing a failover mechanism. If your WordPress site is unable to connect to the official WordPress.org update server, Agent Smith steps in to fetch updates from a specified **GitHub repository**, ensuring your site remains up-to-date even during connectivity issues.

## About The Project

### Built With

- [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Warp Terminal](https://warp.dev)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

All plugin files live inside of the `/src` folder. These are the instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

For all of the awesome people using Node Version Manager (NVM) instead of Node.js, we have an `.nvmrc` file in the repo. For everyone else, please check this file to make sure that your Node.js version matches.

- Switch to correct Node.js Version

```zsh
nvm use
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/carbondigitalus/wordpress-agent-smith-plugin.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages.
    ```zsh
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the start command to watch and build files.

```zsh
npm run start:dev
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Below, you will find our common commands and notes for general usage.

1. Run `npm run build:dev`.
    - When you build in dev, the plugin folder **IS NOT ZIPPED**. This is for those situations where you're working with local instance of WordPress using XAMP, LAMP, MAMP, etc. or even the LocalWP tool (which we use). Those steps are:
        - Build the new plugin folder.
        - Delete the current folder in your WP website.
        - Copy your new plugin folder into the website's plugins folder.
2. Run `npm run build:plugin`.

    - When you build the plugin, the plugin folder **IS ZIPPED** and ready for upload to a WP website.

3. Run `npm run start:dev`.

    - This is runs the default `vite` command. The terminal will tell you to open the browser to a `localhost` port. **We do not use the browser.**
    - A custom hot reload plugin is located in the Vite config file to watch all files in the `/src` folder.
    - Each time a file is changed, the hot reload will trigger a `npm run build:dev`.

<!-- BUILD PROCESS LOGIC -->

## Build Logic

### Vite Build

Vite will convert all of your `.scss` to `.css`. These files, along with all `.js` files, will all be placed in a `/dist` folder, and will be minified.

### Build Plugin

This covers the series of tasks that are used to initially build the plugin folder. Found in both `build:dev` and `build:plugin` scripts.

1. create-plugin-folders

    - This will check to see if the folder `agent-smith` exists. If not, this folder will be created.

2. copy-php-to-plugin-folder

    - This copies the `/src/php` folder over to `agent-smith`.

3. copy-assets-from-dist-to-plugin-folder

    - This copies the `assets` folder from `dist/assets` over to `agent-smith/assets`.

<!-- 4. copy-img-to-plugin-assets

    - This copies the `img` folder from `src/assets/img` over to `agent-smith/assets/img`. -->

4. copy-xsl-to-plugin-assets

    - This copies the `*.xsl` file from `src/**/*` (which is where the sitemap file is located) over to `agent-smith/assets`.

5. convert-php-encoding

    - With Vite, the PHP files don't get the correct file encoding. This step properly converts them to `utf-8` for WordPress.

6. delete-empty-folders

    - This will recursively delete all empty folders from the parent plugin folder `agent-smith`.

7. zip-plugin-core

    - This will zip up folder `agent-smith` and name the new zip with the current version found in the `package.json` file, example `agent-smith-10.4.18.zip`.

### Cleanup Plugin

This covers the series of tasks that are used to clean up the plugin folder after the zip file is created. Found in the `build:dev` and `build:plugin` scripts.

1. delete-plugin-build-folders

    - Delete the `/dist` folder that is generated by Vite.
    - Delete the plugin folder (i.e., `/agent-smith`).
